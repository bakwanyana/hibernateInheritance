# Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) Inheritance Persistence 
While learning Spring Data JPA, I ran into a problem trying to persist classes with multile inheritance.
I found a reference (https://thoughts-on-java.org/complete-guide-inheritance-strategies-jpa-hibernate/) that had four strategies to achieve this and have coded up some example for you to use and compare.

## Strategy Descriptions
### Mapped Superclass

##### find on branch: mappedSuperclass


### Table per Class

##### find on branch: tablePerClass


### Single Table

##### find on branch: singleTable


### Joined

##### find on branch: joined
